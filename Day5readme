**Day4**
Topics Covered: Table spanning, absolute, relative paths, Image tag(src), alt tag, anchor(mailto, tel, wa.me).

Tables(HTML): spanning(rowspan, colspan).
**Absolute path and relative path:**
Absolute path: direct link giving to anchor tag from online
Relative path: giving directory path from local storage to anchor tag

Absolute path:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages:
Consistency: Can be obtained from anywhere
External resources: img soucres or anything can be obtained from online(internet) and can be added in the code.

Disadvantages:
Dependency on domain: Depending on other websites as we are copying sources from online. It will make page loading slower too.
Longer URL's: the sources we are copying from online with URL's will be with more lines of URL makes the code hard to read.  

Relative path:
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Advantages:
Flexibility: Easier to move entire directories or projects without chaning paths.
shoter URL's: More concise and easier to manage.

Disadvantages:
Context Dependent: Paths can break if directories structer changes.
Less clear: Can be harder to understand where the resource is located, especially in deeply nested directories.
